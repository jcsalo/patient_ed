# Introduction
If you or someone close to you has recently been diagnosed with esophageal cancer, this video is intended for you.

I’m Dr Jonathan Salo. I’m a GI Cancer Surgeon.

In this video you’ll learn about:
- Locally advanced esophageal cancer
- Tri-modality Therapy
  - Chemotherapy
  - Radiation
  - Surgery

# Four Stages

Esophageal cancer can have a variety of presentations, from very small cancers which can be treated without surgery, to larger cancers that require a combination of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery.

For our purposes, there are four different stages of esophageal cancer, all of which have different treatment.

If you haven't seen it already, I would recommend

# Cancer Terms
Let‘s start with some definitions
A **tumor** is an abnormal growth
Tumors can be either benign or malignant
A **benign** tumor of the esophagus may grow
over time and cause obstruction and make it
difficult to swallow, but it won’t ever spread
anywhere else

---

 A **malignant** tumor of the esophagus can cause
obstruction but also has the potential to spread
elsewhere in the body.

**Cancer** is another term for a malignant tumor
Unfortunately, the majority of tumors found in
the esophagus are cancer
We will use the term cancer and tumor
interchangeably in this video

---

## Malignant Tumors of the Esophagus = Cancer

In most cases, the diagnosis of esophageal cancer
is made by endoscopy, also called and EGD for
esophagogastroduodenoscopy

---

Under sedation, a flexible scope is passed through
the mouth into the esophagus, which allows
viewing the inside of the esophagus.
If a mass is found in the esophagus, a small
portion can be removed, which is called a biopsy

---

The biopsy is examined by a pathologist, who will
determine whether the tumor is benign or
whether it is a cancer

---

If the biopsy shows cancer, the next step is
staging.
Staging is the process of finding out the size of the
tumor and whether or not there has been spread
to the lymph nodes or other places in the body.
Once the stage has been determined, it will be
possible to determine the best therapy

---

In order to determine the stage, we will focus on
three different areas:
The first is the tumor. How large is the tumor? And
more importantly, how deeply has it grown into
the wall of the esophagus?
The second is whether there is spread to the
lymphy nodes.
The third is whether there is metastasis or spread
to other parts of the body

---

Some drawings will help.
The wall of the esophagus has multiple layers,
shown here.

Surrounding the esophagus are lymph nodes. The
purpose of lymph nodes is to filter the blood and
help fight infections, but in some cases cancers
in the esophagus can spread to the lymph nodes

---


In its earliest stages, cancer of the esophagus
starts on the inner, or most superficial layer,
called with mucosa.
With time, however, the cancer can continue to
grow and invade deeper into the wall of the
esophagus
The deeper the cancer invades into the wall of the
esophagus, the more likely it is that cancer cells
can spread to the lymph nodes

---


If cancer cells spread to the lymph nodes, there is

a chance that some cells will break off and

spread to the liver or lungs.

Metastasis is spread to other parts of the body

such as liver, lungs, or bone.

---

The stage consists of 3 parts:

T for Tumor

N for Nodes

M for Metastasis

---

A T1 tumor involves the top layers of the esophagus

A T1a tumor involves the mucosa

A T1b tumor involves the submucosa

A T2 tumor invades into the muscular layer

A T3 tumor invades all the way through the
muscular layer

A T4 tumor invades into nearby structures such as
the aorta or the airway

---

This may sound confusing, but as a general rule, if
someone with esophageal cancer has difficulty
swallowing, the tumor is usually a T3
There are of course exceptions, but this is a
general guideline
---

The N classification refers to the lymph nodes
N0 – No lymph nodes
N1 – 1 or 2 lymph nodes involved
N2 – 3-6 nodes involved
N3 – 7 or more nodes involved
---

The M classification refers to metastasis
Metastasis = spread of cancer to other organs
such as the lungs, liver, or bone

M0 – No signs of spread to other organs

M1 – Spread to other organs

---

# Diagnostic Tests

Next we will talk about some of the diagnostic
tests that are used for staging.
When you meet with your doctors, one the first
things they will do is to come up with a plan for
testing that is tailored to you and your particular
tumor.

So we will talk about these tests in general terms,
but not all tests are needed for all patients
---
# Scans
The first is scans.

A CT scan is usually the first test for staging. This
will show whether there is any signs of
metastasis or spread to other organs such as
the lung, liver, or bone

---

# PET
A PET scan is a specialized scan which combines
a CT scan with an injection of a small amount of
tracer which lights up areas of cancer.
---

# EUS
In cases where it is important to know about the
exact size of the tumor, an endoscopic
ultrasound exam can be done.

This procedure is similar to an EGD, but the
endoscope has an ultrasound sensor on the end
of the scope which produces an image of the
tumor

---

In some cases, particularly for cancers in the
stomach, it is important to look for signs of
spread in the abdominal cavity. In some
situations, cancers can spread in the abdominal
cavity but the areas are so small they don’t show
up on a CT scan.
In these cases, a laparoscopy is helpful.
---

Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure done under a
general anesthetic.
Several incisions ¼” long are made, and a
telescope is inserted into the abdominal cavity.
This allows an examination of the abdominal cavity
to look for signs of spread.

The procedure is usually done as an outpatient, so
you can go home the same day.
