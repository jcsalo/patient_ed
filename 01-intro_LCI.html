## GI Oncology Clinic

We’re in Building 2 of Levine Cancer Institute. If you’re using GPS, the traffic circle for patient dropoff is located at 1320 East Morehead Street.

The entrance to the building is on East Morehead Street between South Kings and Kenilworth.

---

## Parking

A parking garage is right next door to the traffic circle.

If you need help with directions, please call us at (980) 442-6410

Our mailing address is 1021 Morehead Medical Drive, which is why you will find “1021” on the building.

---

## Covid-19 Safety

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and our desire to
protect both our patients and staff, we no longer
allow visitors to accompany patients during their
visit.

However, we recognize how important it is to have
the support and assistance of family members
and friends, particularly if there is cancer
involved.

---

We do have several ways that we can make sure
that family members and friends can participate
in the initial consultation.

The first is that we can call a family member on
speakerphone during the consultation. You and I
and your family member will all be able to have a
conversation together.

---

## Hybrid Virtual Visits

Another option is a virtual visit through our virtual care portal,
which can be accessed at lci.doxy.me/salo. A link is available in the comments section.
We have a webcam in the consultation room that we can use for a video call with your family member.

---

## What to Expect 

During your consultation, we will review your case
and the information that has been collected so
far.

We may need to do a physical exam of your heart
and lungs, so please wear comfortable clothing.
I will provide you with my evaluation and make a
plan for the next steps

---

## Next Steps

- Additional x-rays, such as a CT scan or PET scan
- An endoscopic procedure
- Placement of a feeding tube for nutrition 
- Placement of a port for chemotherapy
- Scheduling for surgery
- Referral for chemotherapy or radiation

---

## Resources for You and your Family

Cancer affects not
only the patient but the whole community of
family and friends. We have a lot of resources:
- Support groups 
- Counseling to help with stress reduction
- Financial counselors and social workers to help
with insurance and other financial issues
- Supportive Oncology department to help with
managing symptoms

---

## More Resources

We have a full-time staff of **dietitians**

We have an **Integrative Oncology** program which
and can assist you in choosing supplements and complementary therapies to help manage symptoms and promote wellness.

We have a **senior oncology clinic** which can help
with the special needs of our patients over age
75
