I’m Dr Jonathan Salo. I’m a GI Cancer Surgeon.

If you or someone close to you has in

contemplating treatment for esophageal cancer,

this video is intended for you.

In this video, you will learn about

• Four different treatment categories of

esophageal cancer

• Your esophageal cancer care team

2





Once we have determined the Tumor, Nodes, and

Metastasis category, for a tumor, we can begin

to develop a treatment plan.

Here’s where things get a bit complicated

American Joint Commission on Cancer publishes

a book about the staging system for esophageal

cancer, and it’s a bit complex

3





The AJCC staging system is designed for research

and statistics, and it consists of 13 different

categories. As you might imagine, it’s too

complex for our purposes.

The purpose of these videos is for you to have

enough background that you can have an

informed decision with your esophageal cancer

care team.

We’ll talk about that team later in the video

4





For simplicity, we are going to talk about different

treatment categories of esophageal cancer, and

how they are generally treated. You and your

cancer care team will find the right treatment

that’s best for you

5





In general, we can talk about four different

categories of esophageal cancer:

Superficial cancers can frequently be treated with

endoscopy, without the need for surgery

Early stage cancers can be treated with surgery

and frequently don’t require chemotherapy or

radiation

Locally advanced cancers are usually treated with

chemotherapy and radiation first, then surgery

Metastatic cancers are usually treated with

chemotherapy

6





Superficial cancers are T1a and some T1b

cancers. These can frequently be removed from

inside the esophagus with an endoscope and

never need surgery.

Early stage cancers are T1b and some T2

cancers. These are usually treated with surgery

and don’t need chemotherapy and radiation

7





Locally advanced tumors are T3 or node-positive

tumors, meaning N1 or N2 or N3. These cancers

are treated with chemotherapy and radiation

first, which is then followed by surgery.

Metastatic cancers are M1, in which cancer has

spread to other organs. These cancers are

treated with chemotherapy.

To Summarize:

Superficial Cancers can be treated with an

endoscope without the need for surgery using

techniques such as endoscopic mucosal

resection. These tumors are generally T1aN0M0

9





This drawing represents a superficial tumor which

would be a candidate for endoscopic therapy:

The tumor is T1a, and just invades the top layer.

The lymph nodes are N0, which means there is

no signs of spread to the lymph nodes

10





This drawing shows an early-stage tumor which

would be a candidate for primary surgery:

Either T1b or T2, these tumors invade to far into

the wall of the esophagus to be treated with

endoscopic therapy. The lymph nodes are N0,

which means there is no signs of spread to the

lymph nodes

11





This shows a locally-advanced tumor which is

either T3 or has positive nodes, meaning N1 or

N2 or N3

These tumors are best treated by a combination of

chemotherapy and radiation, followed by surgery

12





Esophageal cancer is considered metastatic if

there is signs of spread to other organs such as

the liver, lungs, or bone. These cancers are

considered M1 and are best treated with

chemotherapy.

Esophageal Cancer Care

Team

14





The care of esophageal cancer takes a whole

team working together to give you the best care.

Let’s take a look at the different team members:

15





Gastroenterologist works with an endoscope,

which is a flexible tube which inserted through

the mouth into the esophagus. The

gastroenterologist may perform one of several

procedures in your care:

Upper endoscopy to examine the inside of the

esophagus and stomach and biopsy any

concerning areas

Endoscopic ultrasound is used in some cases to

carefully examine the depth of invasion of a

tumor in the esophagus or stomach

16





A gastroenterologist may also treat superficial

cancers of the esophagus and stomach with

endoscopic therapy such as an endoscopic

mucosal resection

17





Diagnostic radiologist

Interpret CT or PET scans

Perform biopsies under the guidance of CT or

ultrasound

18





Medical Oncologist

Treat cancer with chemotherapy or

immunotherapy, using drugs given intravenously

(and sometimes by pill).

Radiation Therapist

Treats cancer with high-energy x-rays that target

tumors in the esophagus and nearby lymph

nodes

19





Surgeon

Perform surgery to remove the cancer in the

esophagus and surrounding lymph nodes and

reconstruct the gastrointestinal tract. This

usually means creating a new esophagus from a

portion of the stomach.

A surgeon would also place a feeding tube if

needed, and place a central venous port for

chemotherapy.

20





Treatment is based upon stage and the ability of a

patient to undergo treatment

In some cases, treatment decisions are

straightforward, while in others, decision-making

is more complex

Complex cases often require consultation with

other specialists

Esophageal Cancer Treatments





Radiation Therapy: High energy x-ray beams kill

tumor cells in the esophagus and lymph nodes

Chemotherapy: Drugs given intravenously (or by

mouth) which kill tumor cells in esophagus,

lymph nodes, lungs, and liver

Surgery: Removal of esophagus and lymph nodes

with reconstruction of esophagus

Esophageal Cancer Therapy





Chemotherapy + Radiation → Surgery

Used for most T N or T N and some T N

2 1

3 0

2 0

• Chemotherapy + Radiation (5-6 weeks)

• Repeat scans 4 weeks later (CT or PET)

• Surgery 6-10 weeks after end of radiation

24

Tri-Modality Therapy





Administered before (or after) surgery

Treatments 5 days per week x 6 weeks

May cause some inflammation in esophagus

which can make swallowing temporarily worse

(before it gets better).

25

Radiation Therapy





Administered along with radiation therapy

Variety of different regimens

• Most commonly once per week

May require a central venous port for

administration of intravenous medicines

otherapy





Outpatient procedure

Completely implanted (can shower, bathe)

Risks

• Infection (requires removal of port)

• Blood clot under skin

• Clotting of catheter (tube)

• Thrombosis (clotting) of the vein

Removed as outpatient procedure when no longer

needed

27

Central Venous Port





Radiation therapy

• Smoking increased the risk of complications

such as mucositis (inflammation of the mouth

and throat)

• Radiation therapy is not as effective in

smokers

Surgery

• Smoking increases the risk of heart and lung

complications after surgery AND makes it

more difficult for wounds to heal

Critical to stop smoking **today**
