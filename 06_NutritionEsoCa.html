# Introduction

I’m Dr Jonathan Salo, I’m a GI Cancer Surgeon
Esophageal cancer can cause difficulty with
swallowing, which can limit your body’s ability to
get the nutrition you need in order to keep your
body healthy during cancer treatment.
In this video you’ll learn about

- Essential building blocks for good nutrition
- Protein supplements
- Feeding tubes
---
There are four major nutritional building block:
Carbohydrates
Fats
Micronutrients
Protein
---
Carbohydrates are important for energy
There are many different kinds of carbohydrates:
There are sugars, which make food taste sweet
but are also hard on your liver and pancreas
There are starches, which also provide a source of
energy but are easier on your system.
Starches are large molecules made up of a long chain of sugars. 
--
Fats are a second category of nutrients.
Fats make food taste better and are important in
small quantities for rebuilding tissue.
The average American diet, however, contains
more fat than most people need
--
Micronutrients are the vitamins and minerals your
body needs to keep functioning smoothly.
A daily vitamin is enough for most people.
In some cases, your doctor may recommend iron
supplementation, but only if your iron levels are
low
---
# Protein
Protein is the essential building block of tissue in
your body, especially muscle.
If you don’t have enough protein in your diet, you
can lose muscle mass, which can result in
weakness and fatigue
---
Protein is found in meats, fish, eggs, nuts, and
beans.
Your dietitian can give you a more precise number,
but in general the average woman needs 60
grams of protein per day and the average man
needs 75 grams of protein per day
---
For many people with esophageal cancer,
however, eating meat can be difficult.
Because of this, inadequate protein intake is the
most common nutritional problem for patients
with esophageal cancer.
---
For patients who have difficulty eating, we
recommend protein supplements to make
certain they have enough protein to stay healthy.
---
#Protein Supplements
When we talk about protein supplements, we will
talk about two different categories:

- Protein Shakes
- Meal Supplements
---
Protein shakes contain protein and flavoring and
may contain micronutrients, but don’t tend to
contain much in the way of carbohydrates or fat.
An example of a protein shake would be Premier
Protein or Pure Protein.
---
# Meal Replacements
Meal replacements contain protein as well as
carbohydrates, either in the form or sugars or
dietary fiber, along with fats. Examples of meal
replacements would be Ensure or Boost.
---
Your dietitian will help decide whether a protein
shake or meal replacement is best for you, but
for most patients that are able to take at least
some other food, **protein shakes** taste better and
are usually more suitable.
Bear in mind that the average woman need 60
grams of protein per day, and the average man
needs 75 grams of protein per day, so it will be
important to read the label to make certain
you’re getting enough protein
---
For most people with esophageal cancer who
have difficulty eating, things can get worse
during esophageal cancer therapy.
The reason is that the most common initial
treatment in chemotherapy and radiation.
Chemotherapy can tend to depress your appetite.
Radiation can lead to a temporary ‘sunburn’ on the
inside of the esophagus called radiation
esophagitis. This usually gets better after the
radiation ends, but during the radiation it can make it more difficult to swallow.
---
One of the questions you will want to address with your esophageal cancer care team is whether or
not you need a feeding tube to help with yournutrition during cancer treatment.
Your dietitian and physicians will evaluate your situation and made a recommendation.
Let’s take a look at the options:
---
A gastrostomy tube is placed into the stomach by
a surgical procedure. Feedings can be
administered with a syringe. A gastrostomy tube
still allows you to each as much normally as you
would like.

A jejunostomy tube is placed into the jejunum, or
the first portion of the small intestine. Feedings
require a pump and are generally given
overnight, which can take 12-16 hours. A
jejunostomy tube still allows you to each as
much normally as you would like.
---
The decision between a gastrostomy tube and
jejunostomy tube can be a little complex, but
here are some general principles.
For those with stomach cancer who need
supplemental feeding, a jejunostomy tube is
needed.

For patients who undergo surgery on the
esophagus, a jejunostomy tube is frequently
used after surgery
---
For patients who have esophageal cancer and
who are undergoing chemotherapy and
radiation, either a gastrostomy tube or
jejunostomy tube can be used, depending upon
whether or not surgery on the esophagus is
planned.
This is a more complicated decision that your care
team will make in coordination with your
surgeon.
